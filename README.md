# FFBayes: Advanced Fantasy Football Analytics Pipeline

A sophisticated fantasy football analytics system that combines Monte Carlo simulations, Bayesian uncertainty modeling, and Value Over Replacement (VOR) analysis to generate optimal draft strategies and post-draft team analysis.

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Step 1: Setup**
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/nicholas-camarda/ffbayes.git
cd ffbayes
pip install -e .

# Activate conda environment
conda activate ffbayes
```

### **Step 2: Configure Your League**
Edit `config/user_config.json` to set your preferences:

```json
{
  "league_settings": {
    "draft_position": 10,      // Your draft position (1-16)
    "league_size": 10,         // League size (8, 10, 12, 14, 16)
    "scoring_type": "PPR",     // Scoring type
    "ppr_value": 0.5,         // Points per reception
    "risk_tolerance": "medium" // low/medium/high
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Run Pre-Draft Analysis**
```bash
# Generate complete draft strategy
python -m ffbayes.run_pipeline_split pre_draft
```

**What You Get:**
- 📊 **VOR Strategy**: Excel file with traditional rankings
- 🧠 **Bayesian Strategy**: JSON with advanced predictions
- 📋 **Draft Guide**: Complete strategy for your position

### **Step 4: Use During Draft**
- Open `results/2025/pre_draft/vor_strategy/DRAFTING STRATEGY -- snake-draft_ppr-0.5_vor_top-120_2025.xlsx`
- Follow the pick-by-pick recommendations
- Use backup options if primary targets are gone

### **Step 5: Post-Draft Analysis**
After drafting, save your team to `my_ff_teams/drafted_team_2025.tsv`:

```tsv
Name	Position	Team
Patrick Mahomes	QB	KC
James Cook	RB	BUF
# ... your full team
```

Then run:
```bash
python -m ffbayes.run_pipeline_split post_draft
```

**What You Get:**
- 🎯 **Team Analysis**: Player contributions and reliability
- 📊 **Season Projections**: Weekly score expectations with confidence intervals
- 🔍 **Monte Carlo Validation**: 5000 simulations of your team's performance
- 📋 **Team Summary**: Comprehensive analysis and recommendations

## 📊 **What Makes FFBayes Different**

### **🎲 Hybrid Monte Carlo + Bayesian Model**
- **Monte Carlo**: Uses 5 years of actual NFL performance data with 5000 simulations
- **Bayesian**: Adds intelligent uncertainty modeling with confidence intervals
- **Generalization**: Handles new/unknown players through pattern learning
- **Data Integrity**: Robust name resolution with position-aware fuzzy matching

### **🚀 Intelligent Generalization**
Unlike traditional models that fail with new players, FFBayes can:
- **Evaluate Rookies**: Project performance based on position patterns and team context
- **Handle Limited Data**: Use intelligent sampling for players with few games
- **Adapt to Changes**: Project veterans on new teams using historical patterns
- **Quantify Uncertainty**: Always provide confidence bounds, even for unknown players

### **📈 VOR + Advanced Analytics**
- **Traditional VOR**: Industry-standard value over replacement
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Position scarcity, team construction, risk management
- **Result**: Better draft decisions than rankings alone

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **"No players found in database"**
- **Problem**: Player names don't match database format
- **Solution**: Use full names (e.g., "Patrick Mahomes" not "P. Mahomes")
- **Smart Resolution**: The pipeline includes enhanced name resolution for:
  - Initials (e.g., "P. Mahomes" → "Patrick Mahomes")
  - Suffixes (e.g., "Michael Pittman Jr." → "Michael Pittman")
  - Position-aware fuzzy matching

#### **"Pipeline failed with errors"**
- **Problem**: Critical step failed
- **Solution**: Check logs in `logs/` directory for detailed error information
- **Check**: Verify your team file format matches requirements

#### **"Missing required columns"**
- **Problem**: Team file has wrong column names
- **Solution**: Use `Name`, `Position`, `Team` columns (or `POS`, `PLAYER`, `BYE` for legacy format)

### **Team File Format**
Your team file should have these columns:
```tsv
Name	Position	Team
Patrick Mahomes	QB	KC
James Cook	RB	BUF
# ... your full team
```

**Legacy format also supported:**
```tsv
POS	PLAYER	BYE
QB	Patrick Mahomes	10
RB	James Cook	7
# ... your full team
```
