    What we have to do is find a "replacement player" for each position in the draft pool -
    a player who's projected points represents the average postional value at each position.
    Then, with respect to each player's position (this is important. You want to compare each
    player's projected points to their position's replacement value), substract out the replacement
    value you calculated from your replacement player. The value you're left with is each player's
    value over the typical replacement player, or for short, their value over replacement.
