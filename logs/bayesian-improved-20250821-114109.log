Initializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...
Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [nu_minus_one, std_dev_rank, std_dev_rank_b, opp_team_prior, defensive_differential_qb, defensive_differential_wr, defensive_differential_rb, defensive_differential_te, home_additive_prior, away_additive_prior, home_differential_qb, home_differential_rb, home_differential_te, home_differential_wr, away_differential_qb, away_differential_rb, away_differential_wr, away_differential_te, intercept]
Sampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 94 seconds.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.01 for some parameters. This indicates problems during sampling. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08008 for details
The effective sample size per chain is smaller than 100 for some parameters.  A higher number is needed for reliable rhat and ess computation. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08008 for details
Sampling: [fantasy_points]

Default configuration: 7 cores, 1000 draws, 4 chains
