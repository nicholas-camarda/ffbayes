## ffbayes â€” Agent OS Product Overview

**Main Idea**: Data-driven fantasy football toolkit that bridges the gap between football experts and data-savvy novices. Built to help someone with strong statistical skills but no football knowledge compete against experienced fantasy players using Bayesian modeling and advanced analytics.

**Target Users**: 
- Primary: Data-savvy individuals (like medical students) who want to compete in fantasy football against experienced players
- Secondary: Anyone looking for more sophisticated fantasy football analytics beyond basic VOR

### Product Vision
The repository solves the problem of competing in fantasy football leagues where opponents have deep football knowledge and experience. It levels the playing field by:
- Using data science to optimize snake draft strategy (currently VOR-based)
- Applying Bayesian modeling for weekly matchup predictions with uncertainty quantification
- Providing reproducible, evidence-based decision making instead of relying on football expertise

### Additional Documentation
- `plots-organization.md`: Documentation of visualization outputs and plots directory structure

### Environment Management
- **Primary Environment**: PyMC4 environment for modern Bayesian modeling
- **Working Directory**: All operations should be performed from the project root directory (`/Users/ncamarda/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Desktop/coding/ffbayes`)

### Development Standards
- **Working Environment**: The current working directory should always be the project root (`ffbayes/`)
- **Package Execution**: Use console scripts (`ffbayes-*`) or module imports (`python -m ffbayes.*`)
- **Path References**: Use relative paths from the project root for all file operations
- **Environment Setup**: Always run `conda activate ffbayes` before executing any scripts
- **Package Installation**: Install in development mode with `pip install -e .`
- **Testing**: Run tests with `pytest` from the project root

### Critical Package Compatibility Issues (2025-01-19) - âœ… RESOLVED
- **nfl_data_py Version**: Current version still uses `season_type` column (not `game_type` as initially suspected)
- **Data Structure**: Weekly data and schedules maintain consistent column names across versions
- **Root Cause Identified**: The "Series is ambiguous" error was caused by improper pandas row iteration using `iterrows()`
- **Solution Implemented**: Replace `iterrows()` with `itertuples()` for proper scalar value extraction
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED - Script now processes 11,250+ rows successfully across 2023-2024 seasons
- **Performance**: Data collection completed in 3.0 seconds with no errors
- **Output**: Successfully generated season datasets and combined dataset with proper opponent/home-away indicators
- **Key Insight**: This was a pandas best practices issue, not a package compatibility issue

### Major Architectural Improvements (2025-08-19) - âœ… COMPLETE
- **Separation of Concerns**: Data preprocessing separated from analysis scripts
- **Configurable Analysis**: Function parameters for cores, draws, tune, chains (no hardcoded config)
- **Smart Trace Management**: Automatic saving and reuse of expensive PyMC4 sampling results
- **Performance Optimization**: 4.5 minutes â†’ 10 seconds for subsequent Bayesian analysis runs
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and graceful degradation across all scripts
- **Progress Monitoring**: Integrated `ProgressMonitor` with fallback to basic progress bars
- **Proper Testing Framework**: Tests organized in `tests/` folder with configurable parameters
- **Pipeline Robustness**: Enhanced orchestration with better error handling and debugging
