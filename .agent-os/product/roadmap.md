- [x] **Environment Management**: Conda environment working with helper scripts and Makefile

## Phase 1: Script Consolidation and Compatibility (Current Priority)

- [ ] **Legacy Script Analysis**: Evaluate existing `get_ff_data.py`, `montecarlo-historical-ff.py`, and `bayesian-hierarchical-ff.py`
- [ ] **Data Pipeline Consolidation**: Merge legacy data collection into new organized structure
- [ ] **Monte Carlo Fixes**: Resolve recursion issues in `montecarlo-historical-ff.py`
- [ ] **PyMC Compatibility**: Fix PyMC3 issues or complete PyMC4 migration
- [ ] **Script Standardization**: Implement consistent interfaces and error handling across all scripts

## Phase 2: Pipeline Enhancement and Robustness

- [ ] **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- [ ] **Progress Monitoring**: Integrate `alive_progress` across all pipeline stages
- [ ] **Pipeline Orchestration**: Enhance `run_pipeline.py` with proper sequencing and dependency management
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Complete `02_validate_data.py` implementation with comprehensive checks
- [ ] **Logging and Debugging**: Add comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities

## Phase 3: Testing and Validation

- [ ] **Component Testing**: Test each script independently with proper validation
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Test complete pipeline execution end-to-end
- [ ] **Performance Validation**: Assess performance characteristics and optimize bottlenecks
- [ ] **Quality Assurance**: Validate outputs and ensure data integrity
- [ ] **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality is preserved

## Phase 4: Advanced Features and Optimization

- [ ] **Advanced Draft Strategy**: Implement more sophisticated algorithms beyond basic VOR
- [ ] **Uncertainty Quantification**: Better confidence intervals and risk assessment
- [ ] **Bench Player Optimization**: Limited bench management for small leagues
- [ ] **Injury/Practice Status**: Incorporate injury reports into predictions
- [ ] **Weather Integration**: Add weather data for improved accuracy

## Phase 5: Production Features

- [ ] **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools for easy weekly decision making
- [ ] **Configuration Management**: YAML/JSON configs for league settings and preferences
- [ ] **Automated Updates**: Daily/weekly data refresh and projection updates
- [ ] **Performance Tracking**: Track prediction accuracy and model performance over time
- [ ] **Monitoring Dashboard**: Pipeline health monitoring and alerting

## Phase 6: Advanced Analytics

- [ ] **Multi-League Support**: Handle different league formats and scoring systems
- [ ] **Trade Analysis**: Bayesian evaluation of potential trades
- [ ] **Waiver Wire Optimization**: Data-driven waiver wire decisions
- [ ] **Playoff Strategy**: Specialized modeling for playoff scenarios
- [ ] **Machine Learning**: Advanced ML models for player performance prediction

## Current Focus: Script Consolidation

The immediate priority is **Phase 1: Script Consolidation and Compatibility**. This involves:

1. **Evaluating existing implementations** to understand what needs to be preserved
2. **Merging legacy scripts** into the new organized structure
3. **Resolving compatibility issues** with PyMC3/Theano/numpy
4. **Standardizing interfaces** across all pipeline components
5. **Ensuring robust execution** with proper error handling and progress monitoring

This consolidation phase will create a solid foundation for the enhanced pipeline features in subsequent phases.
