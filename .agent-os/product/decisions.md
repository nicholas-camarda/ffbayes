## Product Decisions

### Script Organization and Structure

**Decision**: Organize all scripts into logical directories with clear dependencies and a master orchestrator.

**Rationale**: The existing scripts were scattered across the root directory, making it difficult to understand dependencies and maintain the codebase. The new structure provides clear separation of concerns and makes the pipeline flow obvious.

**Implementation**: 
- `scripts/data_pipeline/`: Data collection, validation, and preprocessing
- `scripts/analysis/`: Statistical modeling and analysis components
- `scripts/utils/`: Utility functions and helper scripts
- `run_pipeline.py`: Master pipeline orchestrator

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All scripts organized and basic structure in place

### Script Consolidation Strategy

**Decision**: Merge legacy scripts into the new organized structure while preserving all existing functionality.

**Rationale**: The user has sophisticated implementations in their legacy scripts that should be enhanced, not replaced. Consolidation will create a unified pipeline while maintaining the sophisticated data processing logic they've developed.

**Implementation**: 
- Analyze `get_ff_data.py` functionality and merge into `01_collect_data.py`
- Fix recursion issues in `montecarlo-historical-ff.py` and integrate into analysis pipeline
- Resolve PyMC3 compatibility issues or complete PyMC4 migration
- Standardize interfaces and error handling across all components

**Status**: 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Analysis phase beginning

### PyMC3 vs PyMC4 Migration

**Decision**: Evaluate both PyMC3 and PyMC4 versions to determine the best path forward.

**Rationale**: PyMC3 has compatibility issues with newer numpy versions, but the existing model logic is valuable. PyMC4 offers modern features and better compatibility but requires migration effort.

**Implementation**: 
- Test PyMC3 compatibility fixes with different package versions
- Evaluate `bayesian-hierarchical-ff-modern.py` PyMC4 implementation
- Choose primary implementation based on performance, stability, and maintainability
- Maintain fallback option if needed

**Status**: 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Both versions available, evaluation needed

### Progress Monitoring Standardization

**Decision**: Use `alive_progress` consistently across all pipeline stages for better user experience.

**Rationale**: Progress monitoring provides clear feedback on long-running operations and helps users understand pipeline status. Consistent implementation across all scripts improves user experience.

**Implementation**: 
- Created `scripts/utils/progress_monitor.py` for centralized progress monitoring
- Integrated progress bars into data collection and validation scripts
- Plan to add progress monitoring to all analysis scripts

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Progress monitoring utility created and integrated

### Pipeline Orchestration

**Decision**: Create a master pipeline script that coordinates all stages with proper sequencing and error handling.

**Rationale**: Running individual scripts manually is error-prone and doesn't provide a unified user experience. A master orchestrator ensures proper execution order and handles failures gracefully.

**Implementation**: 
- Created `scripts/run_pipeline.py` with basic orchestration structure
- Plan to add proper stage sequencing, dependency management, and error recovery
- Add configuration options for pipeline customization

**Status**: 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Basic structure created, enhancement needed

### Environment Management

**Decision**: Use conda environments with helper scripts for easy execution and environment management.

**Rationale**: The user had conda activation issues that were resolved. Using conda environments provides better dependency isolation and the helper scripts make execution easier.

**Implementation**: 
- Created `scripts/run_with_conda.sh` for easy script execution
- Created `Makefile` with common pipeline operations
- Documented environment setup and management procedures

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Environment management working with helper scripts

### Data Pipeline Flow

**Decision**: Establish a clear pipeline flow from data collection through analysis to strategy generation.

**Rationale**: The existing scripts work independently but don't have a clear execution order. A defined pipeline flow ensures data consistency and proper analysis sequencing.

**Implementation**: 
1. Data Collection: `01_collect_data.py` → `02_validate_data.py`
2. Analysis: `montecarlo-historical-ff.py` → `bayesian-hierarchical-ff.py` (or modern version)
3. Strategy Generation: `snake_draft_VOR.py` (can run independently)
4. Pipeline Orchestration: `run_pipeline.py` coordinates all stages

**Status**: 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Flow defined, implementation in progress

### Error Handling and Robustness

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation across all pipeline stages.

**Rationale**: The existing scripts have limited error handling, which can cause pipeline failures. Robust error handling ensures the pipeline continues execution even when individual stages fail.

**Implementation**: 
- Add error handling to all scripts
- Implement graceful degradation for failed stages
- Add comprehensive logging and debugging
- Create recovery mechanisms for common failures

**Status**: 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Basic error handling in place, comprehensive implementation needed

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Use incremental testing approach with quick validation scripts to ensure rapid iteration.

**Rationale**: The user emphasized "small tests so that these iterations don't take a million years." Incremental testing allows for quick validation of changes without running the full pipeline.

**Implementation**: 
- Created quick testing scripts for data validation, collection, and Bayesian modeling
- Plan to implement comprehensive testing framework
- Add unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end pipeline tests

**Status**: 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Quick testing scripts created, comprehensive testing framework needed

## Current Status Summary
